# EWG Shopper's Guide to Pesticides in Produce (2025)
# Source: Environmental Working Group (https://www.ewg.org/foodnews/full-list.php)
# Summary: https://www.ewg.org/foodnews/summary.php
# Version: 2025
# Refresh Schedule: Annual (March/April)
# Trust Level: Research Non-profit - Peer-reviewed methodology
#
# THREE categories (47 items total):
#   - Clean Fifteen (ranks 1-15) - LOWEST residue, conventional OK (~60% no detectable pesticides)
#   - Middle (ranks 16-35) - MODERATE residue, organic beneficial but not critical
#   - Dirty Dozen (ranks 36-47) - HIGHEST residue, organic STRONGLY recommended (96% had pesticides)
#
# Rank: 1 = cleanest, 47 = most contaminated
#
# 2025 Methodology (updated to include toxicity):
#   - Data: 53,692 samples of 47 fruits and vegetables (USDA PDP)
#   - Testing: Produce washed and peeled (as consumers would) before testing
#   - 265 total pesticides and breakdown products identified
#   - Rankings now factor in:
#     1. Number of pesticides detected
#     2. Presence of pesticide residues
#     3. Amount of residue
#     4. Toxicity levels of detected substances
#
# Key findings:
#   - 75%+ of non-organic produce had detectable pesticide residues
#   - 203 pesticides found on Dirty Dozen produce
#   - New 2025 entries: potatoes and blackberries (Dirty Dozen), cauliflower and bananas (Clean Fifteen)
#
# Pesticide Residue Score: 1-100 scale (estimated from rank position)
